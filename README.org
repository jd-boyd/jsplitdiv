* USAGE

Basic usage.  

In the html head, include jquery and the jsplitdiv script.

Create a div (the container) that contains exactly two more divs.  It
is important that outer div by styled with a width and height.  For
example:

: <div id="my_container" style='width: 60%; height:100px'>
: <div id="left_area"><p>Stuff here</p></div>
: <div id="right_area"><p>More Stuff Here</p></div>
: </div>

Then, in a script section, insert a line like:

: $(window).ready(function(event){
:   $('div#my_container').splitdiv( '#left_area', "#right_area" );
: });

* COMPATIBILITY:

This code has been tested in IE 8 and Chrome.

* TODO:
- Test in Firefox and safari, maybe older IE.
- Add vertical splitting.
- Add limits on how far the splitter can move
* BUG/DESIGN LIMITATIONS:
** You can't embed a split inside another split.  
   I'm not sure how useful that would be anyway.  Definitely useful if
   I make vertical splitters work.
