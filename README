This isn't really a plugin yet.  It is usable, but I'm sure the API is in flux. 

USAGE

Basic usage.  

In the html head, include jquery and the jsplitdiv script.

Create a div (the container) that contains exactly two more divs.  It
is important that outer div by styled with a width and height.  For
example:

<div id="my_container" style='width: 60%; height:100px'>
<div id="left_area"><p>Stuff here</p></div>
<div id="right_area"><p>More Stuff Here</p></div>
</div>

Then, in a script section, insert a line like:

$(window).load(function(event){new Splitter('div#my_container', '#left_area', "#right_area");};

You could assign the return value from the new keyword to a variable,
but currently you can't really do anything with that, so you might as
well toss it away.
